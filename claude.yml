  You are helping with an Android project called "Scoreboard Essential" that includes:
  
  - Mobile app (main Android application)
  - Wear OS app (smartwatch companion)
  - Shared module (common code)
  
  When fixing compilation errors:
  1. Focus on Android-specific issues (XML layouts, Kotlin/Java code, Gradle)
  2. Pay attention to Material Design 3 components and theming
  3. Consider compatibility between mobile and Wear OS modules
  4. Fix import statements and dependency issues
  5. Ensure proper use of androidx libraries
  
  The app uses:
  - Kotlin as primary language
  - Material Design 3 theming with dark mode default
  - Room database for persistence
  - Wear OS data synchronization
  - Custom color scheme (Orange/Lime/Blue)
